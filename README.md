## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a visual representation of the monthly global land-surface temperature over time. It uses D3.js to create an interactive heat map that displays temperature variance by month and year.

## Features

- **Interactive Heat Map**: Hover over cells to see detailed information about temperature variance.
- **Tooltip**: Displays additional information about the temperature when hovering over a cell.
- **Legend**: Shows the color scale used to represent different temperature variances.
- **Axes**: X-axis represents the year, and Y-axis represents the month.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: For creating the interactive heat map.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For data manipulation and D3.js integration.
- **Bootstrap**: For basic styling and layout.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-temperature-heatmap.git
